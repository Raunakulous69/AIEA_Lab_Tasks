Logic-LM

Task Description: Given a problem description and a question, parse the problem and question into first-order logic formulas.
The grammar of first-order logic is defined as follows:
1) conjunction: expr1 ∧ expr2
2) disjunction: expr1 ∨ expr2
3) exclusive disjunction: expr1 ⊕ expr2
4) negation: ¬expr1
5) implication: expr1 → expr2
6) iff: expr1 ↔ expr2
7) universal quantifier: ∀x
8) existential quantifier: ∃x
Output format: logic form ::: description

Context: Placeholder context (replace with real sample from paper if desired).

Question: Placeholder question (replace with real sample from paper if desired).

Predicates:
  Dependent(x) ::: x is a person dependent on caffeine
  Student(x) ::: x is a student
  Drinks(x) ::: x regularly drinks coffee
  Jokes(x) ::: x jokes about being addicted to caffeine
  Unaware(x) ::: x is unaware that caffeine is a drug

Premises:
  ∀x (Drinks(x) → Dependent(x)) ::: All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine
  ∀x (Jokes(x) → ¬Unaware(x)) ::: No one who jokes about being addicted is unaware that caffeine is a drug
  (¬Student(rina) → (Dependent(rina) ⊕ Student(rina))) ::: If Rina is not a student, then Rina is either dependent or a student, or neither

Conclusion:
  Jokes(rina) ⊕ Unaware(rina) ::: Rina either jokes about being addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug
