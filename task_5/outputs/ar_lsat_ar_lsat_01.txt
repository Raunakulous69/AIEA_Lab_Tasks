Logic-LM

Task Description: You are given a problem description. The task is to parse the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, defining the domain, variables, and constraints, then evaluate answer options.

Context: Placeholder context (replace with real sample from paper if desired).

Question: Placeholder question (replace with real sample from paper if desired).

Options:
  (A) Farber
  (B) Gombarick
  (C) Hall
  (D) Kanze
  (E) Lha

Declarations:
  stories = EnumSort([Romania, Spain, Tuscany])
  assistants = EnumSort([photographer, writer])
  assigned = Function([interns] -> [stories])
  trained = Function([interns] -> [assistants])

Constraints:
  trained(Gombarick) == trained(Lha) ::: Gombarick and Lha trained in the same field
  trained(Farber) != trained(Kanze) ::: Farber and Kanze trained in different fields
  assigned(Jackson) == Tuscany ::: Jackson is assigned to Tuscany
  assigned(Kanze) != Spain ::: Kanze is not assigned to Spain

Options (Checks):
  is_unsat(assigned(Farber) == Tuscany) ::: (A)
  is_unsat(assigned(Gombarick) == Tuscany) ::: (B)
  is_unsat(assigned(Hall) == Tuscany) ::: (C)
  is_unsat(assigned(Kanze) == Tuscany) ::: (D)
  is_unsat(assigned(Lha) == Tuscany) ::: (E)
